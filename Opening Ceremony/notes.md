## Sometimes I draw
Speaker: Kai Holnes @ Thoughtworks

Things we do to improve:
- Repetition : Do our stuff over and over again (more architecture, more coding) 
- Forming connections :  Research new technologies 
- Fill gaps : Getting outside advice (going to a conference, talking to people, outside perspective)

The activity is important but so is the journey which usually goes throught these phases: 
- Total Failure
- It's okay
- Ehhh?
- Never again...
- It'll work for now

Having creative hobby helps find new perspective. Don't underestimate how creative you are.

- Not just about money
- Look at other aspect of value (e.g. customer satisfaction)
- Fire impact :
    - Where can things go wrong and what are the consequences of that ?
    - e.g. Going throught the scenario of a database restore, ask the question how long can the system be down on black friday ? 

Does consistency or availability is more important ? It becomes a business decision.
- Do we prefer to have a double booked hotel room or no booking getting throught

In ADR, includes the business case to keep a record on why it was decided like that. As an architect or tech lead it is important to note the bias.

Do build a relationship with the business people.

## From the trenches : Closing remarks
Interview: Neil Ford->Rachel Laycock both @ Thoughtworks
Biggest problem we all have:
- Silver bullet thinking.
    - Applying the solution to a problem to all problems.
- If we don't look at mistake of the past, we'll keep repeating the same history.
